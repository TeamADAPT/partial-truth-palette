our task:

The bleeding-edge, production stack

Framework & runtime: Next.js (App Router, RSC) on Bun. Fast dev server, server actions, file-based routing, saasfly template. zero nonsense.

Language & types: TypeScript everywhere. No exceptions.

Design system layer: shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Tailwind, and tailwind-variants for variants and tokens. Icons via lucide-react.

State & data fetching: TanStack Query for async server state. Minimal client state with Zustand when you must. Anything global beyond that is a smell.

API contract: tRPC with Zod schemas. End-to-end types without the GraphQL overhead cosplay.

Forms: React Hook Form + @hookform/resolvers/zod. Fast, typed, and doesn’t fight you.

Database & ORM: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM. Simple, typed SQL that won’t gaslight you at 2 a.m. Use Drizzle Kit for migrations.

Auth: Lucia. Lightweight, framework-friendly, and typed. Session cookies over JWT unless you truly need stateless.

File uploads: UploadThing wired to Next Route Handlers. Works, ships fast, no drama.

Realtime: tRPC websockets. Keep it in the same type universe, skip the “which socket lib” bike shed.

Animations & polish: Framer Motion. Sprinkle, don’t drown.

i18n: next-intl. File-based messages that don’t feel like punishment.

Analytics & events: PostHog for product analytics. Funnels, feature flags, heatmaps without handing your soul to ad tech.

Errors & traces: Sentry + OpenTelemetry. Know what exploded and why, with actual spans instead of vibes.

Testing: Vitest (unit), @testing-library/react (component), Playwright (E2E), axe-core (a11y checks). Green tests or it doesn’t ship.

DX & quality: Biome (formatter + linter), Husky or lefthook for pre-commit, changesets for versioning. Turborepo for workspaces/monorepo. pnpm if you want deterministic installs over Bun’s youthful enthusiasm.

Email & templates: React Email. You write React once, it renders in Outlook’s weird universe.

Feature flags: Unleash. Flip things on safely, like an adult.

How it fits together (so your repo isn’t chaos)

/app: Next App Router routes, server actions for mutations, route handlers for APIs tRPC can call internally.

/server: tRPC routers, Zod schemas, Drizzle models, auth utils. One typesafe boundary, many happy neurons.

/components: shadcn/ui primitives extended with tailwind-variants. Keep them presentational.

**/features/**x: Vertical slices that combine UI + hooks + queries. No cross-feature imports unless shared.

/lib: clients, config, analytics, sentry, otel, helpers.

/tests: Playwright and Vitest live here with sensible fixtures and test data.

Sensible defaults and opinions you’ll thank me for later

Prefer RSC + server actions for writes; cache reads with TanStack Query where interactivity matters.

Zod at the edges only. Don’t carpet your domain with runtime validation you don’t need.

Drizzle migrations checked into git. No “state drift” mysteries.

Keep a design tokens file and wire tailwind-variants to it. Consistency is a feature.

Add a /storybook only if your team does real design-dev collaboration. Otherwise use Ladle or skip it.

Deployment on Ubuntu (since you’re not playing serverless)

Build with pnpm build (or bun build), run Next standalone behind Caddy or Nginx, process manager via systemd.

Postgres via system packages or a managed instance you actually trust. Drizzle migrates on boot in a controlled step, not on every request.

Wire Sentry DSN and OTel exporter envs from systemd units. Logs to journald plus your aggregator of choice.

Upgrade hooks you’ll want on day two

RUM + Core Web Vitals shipped to PostHog.

Progressive hydration for heavy pages.

Image pipelines: next/image with sharp, responsive sizes set correctly.

A11y gates: axe in CI, kill the build on critical.

Rate limiting on route handlers with a tiny Redis bucket
